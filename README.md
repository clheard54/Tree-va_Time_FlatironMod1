### Phase 4: Project Review

When you are ready, schedule a project review with one of your instructors. The format of the review will roughly look like this:

* 3 minutes - Requirements Review
* 5 minutes - App Overview
* 6 minutes - Deep Dive
* 12 minutes - Pair Programming
* 4 minutes - Feedback

-----------------------------------------
* Write a README detailing:
  * How to install your application.
  * How to run your application.
  * How to use your application (commands that can be run).
  * What your program looks like (screenshots).
  * etc.


* Prepare a demo video describing how a user would interact with your working project.
    * The video should:
      * Have an overview of your project. (2 minutes max)


* Prepare a presentation to follow your video. (3 minutes max)
    * Your presentation should:
      * Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
      * Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      * Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      * Present any code you would like to highlight.

      
* Write a blog post about the project and process.
